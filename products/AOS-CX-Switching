# Possible values are os,db,app,lang,framework,device,service,server-app

# db is databases, os is operating systems, lang is programming languages
# app is end-user applications
# lang is programming languages

# What should be used to sort releases. Set to one of:
# releaseCycle/eol/support/release/cycleShortHand/latest/latestShortHand
# which must be present in the releases underneath
sortReleasesBy: "releaseCycle"

# Template to be used to generate a link for the release
# __RELEASE_CYCLE__ will be replaced by the value of releaseCycle
# __CYCLE_SHORT_HAND__ will be replaced by the optional changelogTemplate
# __LATEST__ will be replaced by the value of latest
# __LATEST_SHORT_HAND__ will be replaced by the optional latestShortHand
# __CODENAME__ will be replaced by the optional codename

# You can even use Liquid Templating inside the template, such as:
# https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-__LATEST__
# Do not use a localized URL (such as one containing en-us) if possible
changelogTemplate: "https://link/of/the/__RELEASE_CYCLE__/and/__LATEST__/version"

# Optional template that generates names for every release. Supports same templating as changelogTemplate.
# Default value is `__RELEASE_CYCLE__``
releaseLabel: "MoM Timeturner __RELEASE_CYCLE__ (__CODENAME__)"

# The label that will be used alongside releases labelled with `lts: true`
# Optional, only provide if the product has lts releases that are not called LTS, but something else.
# Default Value is <abbr title='Long Term Support'>LTS</abbr>
# Prefer using an HTML abbr tag, if possible.
LTSLabel: "<abbr title='Extra Long Support'>ELS</abbr>"

# Optional information about how release information can be fetched automatically
# This is mainly used for the `latest` and `latestDate` fields of each release cycle
# Please see https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date/wiki/Automation for more details
# This is currently a WIP, and will not have any impact, but is highly recommended if this can be made available.

  # Support for partialClone is necessary (GitHub does support this)

  # Link to package on NPM

  # An optional regex that defines how the tags above should translate to releases
  # Use named capturing groups
  # Default value should work for most releases of the form a.b or a.b.c
  # default also skips over any special releases (nightly,beta,pre,rc etc)
  regex: ^v(?<major>0|[1-9]\d*)_(?<minor>0|[1-9]\d*)_(?<patch>\d{1,3})_?(?<tiny>\d+)?$
  # A liquid template using the captured variables from the regex above that renders the final version
  # You can use liquid templating here
  template: '..'

# Newer releases go on top of the list, in order
